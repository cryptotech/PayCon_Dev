===========================

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready. The patch will be accepted 
if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
stable release versions of PayCon.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.
